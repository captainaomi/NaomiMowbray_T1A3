## R5 Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to. 
## Reference the chosen style guide appropriately.

PEP 8 is the typical style guide for Python Code, and simply works towards ensuring there's consistency across everyone's Python Code. 

Different things that I had to be careful of and learn to be congruent with included points such as:

- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters, but for flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions (docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72 characters

- Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines, but Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line

- Imports should be grouped in the following order:
    1. standard library imports
    2. related third party imports
    3. local application/library specific imports

## R6 Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
### - at least three features
### - describe each feature
## Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elemenst and concepts: 
### - use of variables and the concept of variable scope
### - loops and conditional control structures
### - error handling
<br>

## R7 Develop an implementation plan which:
### - outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
### - prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
### - provide a dealine, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist item
## Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan
## Provide screnshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan
## > Your checklists for each feature should have at least five items
<br>

## R8 Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application
## You must include:
### - steps to install the application
### - any dependencies required by the application to operate
### - any system hardware requirements
### - how to use any command line arguements made for the application
